&#147;<I>D.A.M. CDs are just like regular CDs, plus more. In addition to containing songs in the standard CD format, D.A.M. CDs 
contain every song on the album in the MP3 format, which means you'll be able to instantly transfer your songs to your 
portable MP3 player or computer hard drive without time-consuming encoding.</I></P>

<P>&#147;<I>D.A.M. CDs also have multimedia features. Just pop the CD in your computer, and a slick interface appears on your 
monitor with photos, links, a customizable playlist and more.</I>&#147; 
<font size="1">(from <A HREF="http://help.mp3.com/help/category/cds.html" TARGET="_blank">help.mp3.com</A>.)</font></P>

<P>The only drawback to a D.A.M. CD is that the audio is taken from the <I>slightly</I> lower-quality MP3 files that 
exist on MP3.COM.  (Technically, MP3 files are encoded at 128kb/s while standard CD audio is encoded at 256kb/s.) <A HREF="http://artists.mp3s.com/albums/9/corum.html" TARGET="_blank">Click here to buy a D.A.M. CD.</A></P>

recorded and professionally mastered, are exactly what you would find on the record store shelves.</P>

<P>If you live in the U.S., we can mail CDs for $11 each ($10 + $1 for shipping).  
We can accept the following payment options.  (If you live outside the US, please 
contact us for payment options.)</P>

and send $11.00 (per CD) to:
