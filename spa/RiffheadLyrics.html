<TR><TD><H2><A NAME="#flightofdusk"></A>FLIGHT OF DUSK &#151; 6:59</H2></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>No human feels the truth.<BR>
I will suffer ever more and die.<BR>
Die in vain.<BR>
Die from careless waste and see the future of mankind.</P>
<P>Breath of air is no aid.<BR>
I must land and live my final day.<BR>
Can&#146;t they see what they&#146;re burning in the air<BR>
is no good for the race?</P>
<P>Red sun shines through the haze.<BR>
Make a dollar there&#146;s no time to waste.<BR>
There&#146;s no time.<BR>
He is selfish, guilty of the tainted skies and my own end.<BR>
Is it fair? My own life depends upon their will.<BR>
Will it change?<BR>
I see no future for my own dying race and the loss of my young.<BR>
Human waste is to blame. Will it ever change? No!</P>
<P>Soaring through the impure skies.<BR>
My stroke becomes ever weaker.<BR>
Life expectancy is due to change.<BR>
My life is a flight of dusk.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>



<TR><TD><H2><A NAME="#trialsandtribulations"></A>TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS &#151; 5:11</H2></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>I see no future for a man who lives in pain. <BR>
Tomorrow&#146;s just another day to face in vain. <BR>
Waiting for the night when I will see the light. <BR>
Do I use both my mind and my might? </P>
<P>Trials and tribulations (hear them calling on)&#151;that&#146;s all there is to life.</P>
<P>No one seems to bother when I break down on my knees and cry. <BR>
I try to smile, but why do I try? <BR>
Fighting for the cause, pain is growing, and I struggle on. <BR>
I see no end; I will mend; that&#146;s all.</P>
<P>No one seems to fathom endless torture that I face everyday. <BR>
But in the end I will always say, Rise!</P></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><H2><A NAME="#toseek"></A>TO SEEK &#151; 4:24</H2></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>Why has it come to this&#151;the persecution of faith?<BR>
Flagrant, notorious, is it all worth dying for?<BR>
Death to human souls it brings, slaying of the free.<BR>
&#147;Give me back my land,&#148; he says. Let the people be.</P>
<P>To seek a new future; to mourn for the people of war.<BR>
To seek a new freedom; to pray for the dying and sore.<BR>
To seek a new homeland; to bring all the chaos to end.</P>
<P>Send your son across the sea so he can wait in line.<BR>
Give him a prayer and a gun to live in all uncertainty.<BR>
Fighting the beliefs of the Israelites.<BR>
Shave your head, sell your soul, and give up all your rights.</P>
<P>Madness corruption, is why we&#146;re over there.<BR>
Drill the land, juice the sand to make our motors run on.<BR>
Draft the boys, pick up their toys, look into their eyes.<BR>
Feeling angry, feeling weak, what a fucking surprise.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>



<TR><TD><H2><A NAME="#1234"></A>12:34 &#151; 3:03</H2></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>And when I arose I looked up.<BR>
This sort of omen was following me, maybe even guiding me.<BR>
And in the next moment it was gone.<BR>
But wouldn&#146;t you know it would come back again and again?</P>
<P>The time is now 12:34. Will it leave me?<BR>
Because it will never change.<BR>
I can&#146;t explain the symbolism. But do I want it to go?</P>
<P>The feeling it brings is that of bad.<BR>
But how can I judge it when nothing bas has happened?<BR>
Or is it a spiritual thing<BR>
that only can be brought out of my inner self?</P>
<P>If you hear what I say, it will happen to you.<BR>
This mystical draw that obtains your full attention.<BR>
To remain clear and open is your goal,<BR>
but all you will see is now the time is 12:34.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>



<TR><TD><H2><A NAME="#judgementrights"></A>JUDGEMENT RIGHTS &#151; 4:06</H2></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>Go away. Leave me be. I&#146;m very tired, can&#146;t you see?<BR>
The judgement game&#151;it&#146;s all the same.</P>
<P>Day after day, searching on for what the people say.<BR>
So we play the judgement game, telling you rules<BR>
that turn you into shameful fools.<BR>
Criticize because you&#146;re different from the normal rule.</P>
<P>Degradate, humiliate the ones that you demand loyalty from.<BR>
So we play the judgement game; turns you all from loyalty.<BR>
Lord of the law and honesty.<BR>
Degradate, humiliate the ones you love.<BR>
Own judgement rights.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>



<TR><TD><H2><A NAME="#creativegrey"></A>CREATIVE GREY &#151; 5:51</H2></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>Running through the forgotten forest, <BR>
cries from all the birds that perch above me.<BR>
Think not the functions of every day.<BR>
Feed your mind with all the creative grey.</P>
<P>Come see what you should know tomorrow,<BR>
be what has come from your planted seed,<BR>
and dream of what tomorrow holds for you<BR>
&#151;what has become your creative grey.<BR>
Teach your grey.</P>
<P>Like a hundred-way lightbulb, your head sits on your shoulders.<BR>
God is not a he. God is not a she.<BR>
God is energy, and it shall be yours.</P>
<P>And now we reach into the parts of our brain that we cannot see.<BR>
And now we reach into the parts of our brain that we cannot say.<BR>
And now we reach into the parts of our brain that we cannot feel.<BR>
And now we reach into the parts that we will call creative grey.</P>
<P>Now you know the secret,<BR>
and you must use it for the wise.<BR>
Go teach the herd; speak the word.<BR>
And let the grey spew out of your eyes.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>



<TR><TD><H2><A NAME="#tangents"></A>TANGENTS &#151; 5:41</H2></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>Rise above the glory seekers.<BR>
Nothing can they say.<BR>
And for you knowledge will provide your goal.<BR>
Go forth and achieve what&#146;s set inside your soul.</P>
<P>Think of the illusions that are set inside your brain.<BR>
With hope for fulfillment of your struggling.<BR>
You will find the dreams that you are fighting for.<BR>
Time is running short, you know.<BR>
Go forth. Do show.</P>
<P>To be wise or play the fool in your own situation.<BR>
Guide your strength in the direction you know.<BR>
Fear no fear to make your persistence grow.</P>
<P>Tangent subject matter increase thoughts to bare their own goal.<BR>
Speak up, son.  Vocabulary utilized.<BR>
Work your mind. Tangents come in realized.<BR>
Time is running short, you know.<BR>
Go forth. Do, show.</P>
<P>Listen to what I mean; don&#146;t listen to what I say.<BR>
Daybreak comes. New mind to explore new views.<BR>
Down with the political avenues.<BR>
Time is running short, you know.<BR>
Go forth. Do, show.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>



<TR><TD><H2><A NAME="#brickfight"></A>BRICKFIGHT &#151; 3:55</H2></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>Run from your brother. I will provide pain for others.<BR>
Holding onto fury because we&#146;re brutalizing weary.<BR>
Another brickfight.</P>
<P>Brickfight! I won&#146;t protect you.<BR>
I will regret you. I will subject you.</P>
<P>Casting stones upon her. Reason for creed, race, or color.<BR>
Feeding on their anger. Rocks fly to bludgeon heads of others.</P>
<P>Run cocksucker. I&#146;m after you, motherfucker.<BR>
Holding onto fury because we&#146;re brutalizing weary.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
