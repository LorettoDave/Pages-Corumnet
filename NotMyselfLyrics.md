				So now I see every inch I gave to you is gone.<BR>
				You, only to return the look on your face<BR>
				telling me your sad story.<BR>
				I don&#146;t believe you&#151;why I didn&#146;t know why.<BR>
				To deceive me was your goal, and you lied.<BR>
				Bite the hand that feeds you no more;<BR>
				chores and deeds you will not receive.<BR>
				Call on me; I won&#146;t be there for you no more.<BR>
				Will I guide? You make excuses.<BR>
				Left in a pool of pity. Poor little boy.

			<P>
				(I know you well.)<BR>
				What a fool I was to take your word because<BR>
				you leaned on me when you were strong.<BR>
				(More than you know.)<BR>
				I guess you never saw how hard I worked for you.<BR>
				Thanking me was only last.
			</P>
			<P>
				Proctology is the way that you clothe and feed yourself.<BR>
				You&#146;re not a doctor, so I refuse to pay.<BR>
				Hand over fist out the door you go&#151;out of my life.<BR>
				Stay away; leave me alone; and I repeat<BR>
				your empty promises which I refuse to deal.<BR>
				Your mouth is moving, but no truth comes out your<BR>
				little hole.<BR>
				Life like a hungry hunting leach: parasitic in act.<BR>
				You try to teach me one way to fill my huge void<BR>
				of self rely you don&#146;t possess.

				I found one meaning of life today:<BR>
				While others cast me away,<BR>

				Do not need money; just a place to lie.<BR>

				Sitting in the wide, <BR>
