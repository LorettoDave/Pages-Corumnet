<p class="title">Level 1: Turtle Woods<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span>, <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span>, and <span class="bluegem">Blue Gem</span> &#151; 102 boxes</p>

<p class="title">Level 2: Snow Go<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span>, <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span>, and <span class="redgem">Red Gem</span> &#151; 74 boxes</p>
<p>After completing the bonus area, you will be dropped off at the checkpoint crate. Make sure to walk Crash backward or you will surely miss a special crate. </p>

<p class="title">Level 3: Hang Eight<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span>, <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span>, and <span class="cleargem">Clear Gem</span> &#151; 74 boxes</p>
<p>The <span class="bluegem">Blue Gem</span>, which was acquired in Turtle Woods, will allow you to warp to the extra river area. This area must be taken in order to find all the boxes. Note: The <span class="bluegem">Blue Gem</span> will drop you off at the same area where you started. </p>
<p>The level has to be gone through two times to gain all three items. You can get the crystal and <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span> the first time through, but you must do the level a second time to get the <span class="cleargem">Clear Gem</span>. </p>
<p>The second time through, at the first checkpoint, you will be given a time limit in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. To gain the <span class="cleargem">Clear Gem</span>, complete the level within the allotted time. The key: Do not attempt to get any boxes unless they are the Aku Aku crates. </p>

<p class="title">Level 4: The Pits<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span> and <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span> &#151; 53 boxes</p>
<p>Here, the level comes to a fork. The crystal is located on the left path. Take this route first, eliminate all the enemies, then trace your steps back to the beginning. </p>

<p class="title">Level 5: Crash Dash<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span> and <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span> &#151; 44 boxes</p>

<p class="title">Level 6: Snow Biz<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span> and <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span> &#151; 124 boxes</p>
<p>After exiting the 3D area and entering the 2D area, you will come across the <span class="redgem">Red Gem</span>. Hop on for a ride to a secluded area that will allow you to get the box count you need. </p>
<p>(In hidden area) use the block to bounce and activate the three TNTs overhead. It may be out of sight, but bounce again on the arrow block to activate the exclamation crate. </p>

<p class="title">Level 7: Air Crash<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span>, <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span>, and <span class="cleargem">Clear Gem</span> &#151; 102 boxes</p>

<p class="title">Level 7-to-2 Warp</p>
<p>The skull-and-crossbones platform will only be visible if you haven't lost a life in the level yet. By taking this platform, you'll be taken to an alternate end of the level where the <span class="cleargem">Clear Gem</span> awaits you. The reason to take this path first is because you can't get the <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span> just yet. You must warp in from Level 13, just like you did in Level 2.</p>

<p class="title">Level 8: Bear It<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span> and <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span> &#151; 48 boxes</p>

<p class="title">Level 9: Crash Crush<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span> and <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span> &#151; 57 boxes</p>
<p>After the first boulder, you will come up to a fork in the road. Take the alternate path back to grab some boxes and fruit. A warp platform will be waiting for you at the end to transport you back to the fork. </p>
<p>Perfect timing is needed in this stage to access the bonus area. Duck in quickly. </p>

<p class="title">Level 10: The Eel Deal<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span> and <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span> &#151; 80 boxes</p>
<p>In the dead-end fork, carefully jump past the nitros to the sealed door, and you'll discover that the door isn't sealed at all! Walk through to enter the secret tunnels and get the green gem. </p>
<p>At one area, there is a box completely out of sight on top of the five steel crates. </p>

<p class="title">Level 13-To-7 Warp</p>
<p>Instead of going in order to Level 11, head to Level 13 first. This way, you can find the warp that will take you back to Level 7. Once there, you will be able to collect the boxes needed in order to get the <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span> from the level. </p>
<p>Upon reaching the end of Level 13, turn back toward the water to see a series of floating ice platforms. The middle is the warp! </p>
<p>After starting in the middle of level 7, skip the skull-and-crossbones - it will take you to the alternate ending with no boxes. </p>

<p class="title">Level 11: Plant Food<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span>, <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span>, and <span class="yellowgem">Yellow Gem</span> &#151; 53 boxes</p>
<p>Before jumping on the surfboard, take the right path and collect the boxes while eliminating the plants. This will make it easier while on the surfboard. Note: You won't have this luxury when going for the time completion. </p>
<p>As you reach the first checkpoint, you will notice another timer pop up on the bottom corner of the screen. This is the time needed to finish the level. Do this, and you will get the <span class="yellowgem">Yellow Gem</span>. First, concentrate on getting the <span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span> and the <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span>. You can work on the time completion after you are more familiar with the level. </p>

<p class="title">Level 12: Sewer or Later<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span>, <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span>, and <span class="cleargem">Clear Gem</span> &#151; 56 boxes</p>
<p>The <span class="yellowgem">Yellow Gem</span> platform in the center of a hole in the floor, but for now, head through the doors behind it. As you make your way through the tunnels, you can bounce off the rolling barrels to clear the path for a return trip. </p>
<p>Skip the bonus area and head for the checkpoint box first. Use the reappearing scrub robots to knock out the fan blades one at a time. After grabbing the checkpoint box, shoot down to the 2D bonus area. After collecting all the boxes, make your way back to the <span class="yellowgem">Yellow Gem</span> platform. </p>
<p>Take out the two scrub robots guarding the <span class="cleargem">Clear Gem</span>, and head back to the <span class="yellowgem">Yellow Gem</span> platform. After going there and grabbing the boxes, you will be dropped off at this area (see picture #3). Use the scrub robot to destroy the wall of boxes. </p>
<p>At the forked path, first take the right path until you come across two exclamation boxes. Spin into these, then head back and take the left path. Now grab the <span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span>, and smash the boxes that are now visible as a result of activating the exclamation boxes. </p>

<p class="title">Level 13: Bear Down<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span> and <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span> &#151; 51 boxes</p>
<p>Level 13-To-7 Warp: Upon reaching the end of Level 13, turn back toward the water to see a series of floating ice platforms. The middle is the warp! </p>

<p class="title">Level 14: Road to Ruin<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span> and <span class="cleargem">Clear Gem</span> &#151; 89 boxes</p>
<p>The outlined platform is the key to finding the <span class="cleargem">Clear Gem</span>. First, you must find the correct exclamation box…or boxes? </p>
<p>More like a mid-Boss than an enemy, this ape will do anything to stop you from getting the gem. A spin jump works the best here. </p>

<p class="title">Level 15: Un-Bearable  <br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span>, <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span>, and <span class="cleargem">Clear Gem</span> &#151; 58 boxes</p>
<p>Crash into the checkpoint box first, then jump down after the bear to discover a secret 2D area loaded with boxes and enemies. </p>
<p>In the hidden area: A quick spin move will send the sawback turtle flying into the nitro crate. This will buy you some time to defeat the big-game hunter. </p>

<p style="page-break-before: always" class="title">Level 16: Hangin' Out<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span> and <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span> &#151; 93 boxes</p>
<p>You must beat this level twice - first for the <span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span> and white <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span>, then for the Level 27 warp. </p>
<p>You'll see the <span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span> next to a checkpoint box midway through the level, after falling down a hole. </p>
<p>Bonus Room: A short slide jump will easily get you over the nitro boxes to the arrow boxes. </p>
<p>Remember where the <span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span> was? This time, go backward instead of going through the door. You'll see a hole. Fall down it. </p>

<p class="title">Level 17: Diggin' It<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span>, <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span>, and <span class="whitegem">White Gem</span> &#151; 95 boxes</p>
<p>You must beat this level twice - first for all the gems and once for the Level 14 warp. </p>
<p>Make it to the platform without dying to activate this skull-and-crossbones platform. Technique: You can make it past the field of nitro boxes without taking a hit. First, jump right - onto the grass. Then jump over the boxes to the left. The <span class="whitegem">White Gem</span> lies near the end of this path. </p>
<p>You must double back on the right path to make sure you get all the boxes on that side.</p>
<p>Bonus Room: Hop on the tall box columns to reach a metal platform that has extra lives on it.</p>
<p>Body-slam the spitting piranha plant on the isolated platform to unlock the secret warp to Level 14: Road to Ruin. However, you don't need this warp to get all the boxes in Level 14! All you need is an Aku Aku. At the start of Level 14, where you kill the first mouse, do a slide jump left over some invisible boxes. You should be able to reach an exclamation point box. Continue left past two fire-breathing statues to four suspicious nitro boxes. Intentionally run into the nitro boxes, which should kill the Aku Aku but not you. Then jump backward to find the path to the hidden boxes in Level 14. No warp needed! </p>

<p class="title">Level 18: Cold Hard Crash<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span>, <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span>, and <span class="whitegem">White Gem</span> &#151; 155 boxes</p>
<p>The only way to get the <span class="whitegem">White Gem</span> is to reach the checkpoint without getting killed. This will activate the skull-and-crossbones platform. The ice in this area is treacherous to navigate, but you're rewarded with the <span class="whitegem">White Gem</span> at the end. </p>
<p>To get all the boxes, you have to repeat what you did for the first <span class="whitegem">White Gem</span>. However, rather than fall down the pit at the end, you must backtrack all the way to the skull-and-crossbones platform where you started. </p>
<p>You might have forgotten about an invisible box near the start of the skull-and-crossbones path. It becomes visible after hitting the exclamation (before dropping down to get the gem). Don't fall off the edge! </p>
<p>An extra life box is hidden behind the two nitro boxes in a ledge. Don't forget to break it. You can jump on that box without breaking the nitro boxes - just make sure to hug the walls. </p>
<p>There'll be a box up high that may seem out of reach, but it can be broken with a short slide jump. </p>
<p>At the end of the room, you might accidentally miss a TNT box that won't get blown up by other TNT boxes near it. Make sure to backtrack at the end of the level to be sure you got it. </p>

<p class="title">Level 19: Ruination<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span>, <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span>, and <span class="whitegem">White Gem</span> &#151; 84 boxes</p>
<p>You must beat this level twice - first for the purple and first <span class="whitegem">White Gem</span>, then for the white <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span>. WARNING: You will need the green gem to complete this level! </p>
<p>Hop on the <span class="greengem">green gem</span> platform next to the checkpoint. You'll have to jump past some tough log-throwing apes, but beyond them is the gem. </p>

<p class="title">Level 20: Bee-Having<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span> and <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span> &#151; 100 boxes</p>

<p style="page-break-before: always" class="title">Level 21: Piston It Away<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span>, <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span>, and <span class="whitegem">White Gem</span> &#151; 69 boxes</p>
<p>To get the <span class="whitegem">White Gem</span>, you must make it to a spot just after the second checkpoint without dying. It'll take you to the upper level where the gem is. </p>
<p>To get all the boxes, make sure you get to the skull-and-crossbones platform without dying so that it's turned on. But don't hop on yet! Keep going. Immediately after that platform is an energy cannon and a shock robot. DO NOT KILL THIS ROBOT YET! Slide jump over it and keep moving. Complete the bonus room and go forward all the way to break the box near a bunch of nitros (in the background). Now, you must backtrack. There will be two tough spots. Slide jump to reach the platform without getting hit. Finally, remember the shock robot you didn't kill? Use it as a springboard to get over the energy cannon. Now get on the skull-and-crossbones platform! </p>
<p>Bonus Room: To get all the boxes in this room without getting hit, don't break the three boxes between the nitro and the lift. After you hit an exclamation box at the end, go back to the beginning, using the three boxes you saved to jump over the nitro boxes. </p>

<p class="title">Level 22: Rock It<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span> and <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span> &#151; 39 boxes</p>

<p class="title">Level 23: Night Flight<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span>, <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span>, and <span class="whitegem">White Gem</span> &#151; 46 boxes</p>
<p>The <span class="whitegem">White Gem</span> will be in plain view on the left-hand path. The only way to get this gem, however, is to reach the skull-and-crossbones platform without dying. </p>
<p>You can get all the gems one time through, but it requires smart use of the checkpoint boxes. When you pass the second checkpoint, don't hit it. Instead, follow the right-side path to the boxes. You can break the boxes without hitting the nitro box. Just do a slide jump to land on the top box, then jump away after breaking the second box. Quickly return to that second checkpoint box and hit it. That will record the number of boxes you've already broken - so you don't have to go back and break them every time! Your light will run out here, so you must sacrifice a life. Now take the left-hand path to get the first <span class="whitegem">White Gem</span>. The two paths will merge back into one. Hit the checkpoint box near the end, then grab the firefly light and head backward on the right path to find the bonus room. After the bonus room, go backward to the last checkpoint box and <span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span>. It'll be tough to do, so move fast before the light flickers away. You may have to sacrifice another life here when the light runs out. </p>
<p>Bonus Room: Make sure to break the two bounce boxes first before getting the firefly. This will give you enough light to reach the end of the room. </p>

<p class="title">Level 24: Pack Attack<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span> and <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span> &#151; 46 boxes</p>

<p class="title">Level 25: Spaced Out<br>
<span class="purplecrystal">Purple Crystal</span>, <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span>, and <span class="whitegem">White Gem</span> &#151; 49 boxes</p>
<p>You must beat this level twice - once for the purple and white <span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span>, then for the first <span class="whitegem">White Gem</span>. WARNING: All five big colored gems are needed to get this gem! </p>
<p><span class="whitegem">White Gem</span>: See that <span class="bluegem">Blue Gem</span> in the background (below and away)? It's easy to miss, but that platform near the start of the level will take you up to the last gem. No boxes to break here, but there are plenty of extra players and deadly enemies - hands down the toughest area in Crash Bandicoot 2. It shouldn't be too bad if you've mastered the slide.</p>
<p>Save a copy of your saved game before getting this gem, so you can beat the game to see both the good (100 percent found) and bad (less than 100 percent found) endings! </p>
<p>You don't need to take the alternate path to get all the boxes! Just run through the level normally. </p>
<p>Bonus Room: Breaking all the boxes requires finesse. First, spin-break the second extra-life box, taking care not to hit the TNT box. You have three seconds to slide jump up to the first column of boxes [screenshot] and slide jump again to the top [screenshot]. After the TNT blows up, body-slam to break all the boxes. </p>

<p style="page-break-before: always" class="title">Level 26: Totally Bear<br>
<span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span> &#151; 40 boxes</p>
<p>At the end of Level 15 (Un-Bearable), do a sliding jump across the final chasm and head backward. You'll find the little bear you rode on that will warp you to Level 26. </p>

<p class="title">Level 27: Totally Fly<br>
<span class="boxgem">Box Gem</span> &#151; 44 boxes</p>
<p>Warp to here from Level 16 (Hangin' Out).</p>
<p>The only tricky part in this surprisingly easy level begins with the reinforced crates (body-slam to break them). DON'T GET THE FIREFLY LIGHT. To make it past with enough light, you must feel all six reinforced crates in the dark! Don't worry about falling in a pit. There are rows of wumpa fruits that'll warn you of a pit ahead, which means you've gone too far up to break the crates. Your best bet is to scout out this area with the firefly to get a good idea of where all the crates are. (You might have to sacrifice a life in the process.) </p>

<p class="title">Boss: Ripper Roo</p>
<p>Ripper Roo's first attack is bouncing across the floor dropping different-timed TNT crates. Steer clear of the crates, and do not try to attack just yet. </p>
<p>Ripper Roo's second attack is the same as the first, except this time with nitro boxes. After the last nitro box is set, Ripper will bounce on the box and become dizzy for a short period. </p>
<p>This is when you can use the spin attack to take away one of his health bars. </p>

<p class="title">Boss: Komodo Bros.</p>
<p>Moe is the mastermind in the middle. Stay away from him at all costs. Joe is taking orders to attack you. As he spins around the level, your only defense is to spin back at him and to bounce him away. </p>
<p>After fighting off Joe's multiple attacks, he will spin himself dizzy. When he hits the floor, it's time to make your move. Use your spin move to send Joe crashing into Moe in order to knock off one health bar. </p>
<p>Be alert! Moe's next move will be to toss a series of knives in a counterclockwise position. Stay on the move, and dodge the attacks until Moe sends Joe spinning at you again. </p>

<p class="title">Boss: Tiny Tiger</p>
<p>The Boss will follow you around. To hurt him, trick him into falling. As a platform turns red, jump on it, then jump onto a green platform. If done right, the Boss will jump on the red platform just as it's falling. You must do this three times; it gets tougher because the number of "safe" platforms drops after every hit. </p>
<p>Don't panic if you're stuck at a dead end. You can reach a far-off platform with a sliding jump. What's even better is that the Boss can't slide jump, so he'll follow you and fall like an idiot. </p>

<p class="title">Boss: N. Gin</p>
<p>First, shoot wumpa fruits to destroy this Boss's lasers - each laser requires about eight hits. You can jump over or walk under the laser to avoid it. Next, shoot at the Boss's shoulder missile launchers - each launcher requires roughly eight hits. The missiles that fall vertically can be snuffed out by jumping and/or shooting them. For the horizontal missiles, jump over the low ones and stand under the high ones. </p>

<p class="title">Boss: Dr. Neo Cortex</p>
<p>For a final Boss, Mr. Cortex is ridiculously easy. You must chase him and get close enough to spin-attack him. Avoid boulders and mines; they will slow you down.</p>
