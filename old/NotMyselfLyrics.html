<P>These are the things that we don&#146;t talk about<BR>
&#145;cause it&#146;s affecting everyone we know,<BR>
and we don&#146;t talk about <BR>
because it makes us so uncomfortable.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
Failures never to rise in conversation;<BR>
success stressed&#151;exclamation.<BR>
And what about your home, your life, your beliefs?</P>
<P>These are the things that we don&#146;t talk about<BR>
because it might ruffle some feathers up,<BR>
and we don&#146;t talk about it, <BR>
and it makes us kind of nuts.</P>
<P>These are the things that we don&#146;t talk about<BR>
&#145;cause people probe our lives day after day,<BR>
and we don&#146;t talk about <BR>
because we hope it will just go away.</P>
<P>These are the things that we don&#146;t talk about:<BR>
this message always hitting in the face,<BR>
and we don&#146;t talk about <BR>
resulting guessing error is the case.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<P>So now I see every inch I gave to you is gone.<BR>
You, only to return the look on your face<BR>
telling me your sad story.<BR>
I don&#146;t believe you&#151;why I didn&#146;t know why.<BR>
To deceive me was your goal, and you lied.<BR>
Bite the hand that feeds you no more;<BR>
chores and deeds you will not receive.<BR>
Call on me; I won&#146;t be there for you no more.<BR>
Will I guide? You make excuses.<BR>
Left in a pool of pity. Poor little boy.</P>
<P>(I know you well.)<BR>
What a fool I was to take your word because<BR>
you leaned on me when you were strong.<BR>
(More than you know.)<BR>
I guess you never saw how hard I worked for you.<BR>
Thanking me was only last.</P>
<P>Proctology is the way that you clothe and feed yourself.<BR>
You&#146;re not a doctor, so I refuse to pay.<BR>
Hand over fist out the door you go&#151;out of my life.<BR>
Stay away; leave me alone; and I repeat<BR>
your empty promises which I refuse to deal.<BR>
Your mouth is moving, but no truth comes out your<BR>
little hole.<BR>
Life like a hungry hunting leach: parasitic in act.<BR>
You try to teach me one way to fill my huge void<BR>
of self rely you don&#146;t possess.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<P>Shackled from inside. Injury limits pride.<BR>
I am my lesser self. I scream a cry for help.</P>
<P>This is my cry. Hear my cry. Bring me back alive.</P>
<P>I found one meaning of life today:<BR>
While others cast me away,<BR>
the freedom to move as I please;<BR>
bow down&#151;I do to the God of knees.<BR>
Do not need money; just a place to lie.<BR>
Believe; I still dream for the sky.<BR>
Say it without mobility.<BR>
You hear me cry. You hear me scream.</P>
<P>Sitting in the wide, <BR>
confining walls hold me inside.<BR>
I am too weak to move myself.<BR>
I need to cry. I need some help.<BR>
None of this is what it seems.<BR>
Can&#146;t rid myself nightmare; no dream.<BR>
Arteries aching. No sleep tonight.<BR>
I&#146;m forced to face this waking bite.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<P>I see colors racing down the walls at me<BR>
&#151;inching toward me like road before me;<BR>
broken stripes and contiguous lines forming<BR>
in colors of yellow and black.</P>
<P>All my life I&#146;ve dreamed of telling stories<BR>
&#151;ones like on the silver screen.<BR>
Mystery is right on top of my list.<BR>
They come out as real life or dreams.</P>
<P>I&#146;m looking out. I see the world<BR>
&#151;each cloud lined in silver.<BR>
Now I&#146;m sitting down. I&#146;m out in the world.<BR>
These days even the clouds have friends.<BR>
Looks to me like Mario: hat, mustache, and all<BR>
&#151;legs no longer than his head.<BR>
Silver breaking down, fading into white light.<BR>
They&#146;re playing hide and seek again.</P>
<P>Sitting in my chair I find it hard to move.<BR>
At times I forget I&#146;m dreaming.<BR>
Like all good things this will come to an end.<BR>
Wait, now another begins.</P>
<P>Back in the room where this whole thing started,<BR>
those gathered outside cannot hear.<BR>
Living their reality, I&#146;m living mine.<BR>
Time it moves on free and clear.</P>
<P>Beaming, glowing. <BR>
Little red bugs where are you going?<BR>
You should have been there.</P>
<P>Spinning, turning <BR>
on rivet red &#145;cause you&#146;re burning.<BR>
When can&#146;t find nervous system make no sound.</P>
<P>Synchronized, I&#146;m mesmerized <BR>
watching intently though your demise.<BR>
All left in panic stricken mode, they were.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<P>I&#146;m breathing. You can&#146;t stop me.<BR>
Succeeding. You can&#146;t wrong me.<BR>
I&#146;ve awakened more that ever.<BR>
Time is now. Watch me deliver.<BR>
Not wasting things you squander.<BR>
Keep focus; no more wander.<BR>
What I have of both sides.<BR>
Confidence in me resides.</P>
<P>You mock me. I&#146;m listening <BR>
with back turned. Hear so clearly.</P>
<P>I&#146;ve lived my life without regrets.<BR>
I&#146;ve done more that you care to admit.<BR>
So what if it is not done your way?<BR>
I&#146;ve lived each one and every day.</P>
<P>Created by yourself <BR>
with remarks I won&#146;t forget.</P>
<P>The day is coming soon. <BR>
Too bad I won&#146;t share it with you.</P>
<P>Still breathing&#151;never stopped me.<BR>
Successful&#151;never wronged me.<BR>
Awake and looking at you.<BR>
Time now, tell me what you do.<BR>
Not wasting. You can&#146;t live by.<BR>
Keep focus. You will deny.<BR>
What I have you block outright.<BR>
Confidence&#151;not in your life.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<P>Fighting my biology during the <BR>
last three thousand years.<BR>
Such a short time, <BR>
yet some want so much.<BR>
Can&#146;t we just give it some time? <BR>
When will we realize<BR>
sudden change will always leave us <BR>
short?</P>
<P>I am not myself when I&#146;m around you<BR>
&#151;no one real; I am not real.<BR>
You are not yourself, and it is so true<BR>
&#151;no one real; I am not real.<BR>
We are lying when everything&#146;s a mystery<BR>
&#151;no one real; I am not real.</P>
<P>Stepping out you&#146;ll see it all.<BR>
You&#146;re a fake, and you&#146;re a fake.<BR>
A smile that looks forced like yours <BR>
just won&#146;t get you far.<BR>
Can&#146;t you see? Can&#146;t you tell that <BR>
we are all sexist, racist, back-stabbing? <BR>
Accept that, or lie to yourself.</P>
<P>I am not myself when I&#146;m around you<BR>
&#151;no one real; I am not real. </P>
<P>This is me.</P>
<P>Now a new face upon the scene.<BR>
Your personality will shift .<BR>
Involuntarily hide what we think and feel.<BR>
Disguise what we say<BR>
&#151;laughing until they go away.</P>
<P>I will not feed your picture of me.<BR>
I will not change to you from me.</P>
<P>Why this instant metamorphosis?<BR>
Is it necessary to please you? I question.<BR>
Is it necessary to please someone questionable?<BR>
I am not myself because you&#146;re <BR>
right in front of me.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<P>You&#146;re always talking, but you&#146;ll never be heard.<BR>
You wanted first, but you&#146;ll always be third.<BR>
Remember nothing&#151;alcoholic blur.<BR>
Think you&#146;ll ask her, but you&#146;ll never be sure.<BR>
Twisted mind; you wish your thoughts were cleaner.<BR>
This overwhelm you can never deter.<BR>
Well wishes, but they didn&#146;t occur.<BR>
All because you didn&#146;t lift a finger.</P>
<P>In things with meaning you were never concerned.<BR>
Wanted to know, but you never did learn.<BR>
Your mouth wide open, but it wasn&#146;t your turn.<BR>
And spent the money that you know you can&#146;t earn.<BR>
Knocking me although you know you&#146;re a turd.<BR>
The goals in which you wish you could&#146;ve conquered<BR>
are mounting in a file of never referred<BR>
just like a pile of people not remembered.</P>
<P>I wish you well my friend&#151;like all the others.<BR>
Each time you screw someone and toss them out<BR>
like old furniture, I will give everything I&#146;ve got to<BR>
end your schemes prematurely. Until you turn your<BR>
take to giving, you will be labeled by the same name:<BR>
Overunderachiever.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<P>You don&#146;t take me seriously; I will show you.<BR>
Won&#146;t waste my pride on you; won&#146;t waste my time.<BR>
Energy depleting; must keep my focus.<BR>
Time is my guide, and the sun is my light.</P>
<P>The goal created in my mind.<BR>
Deceptive truth is still a lie.<BR>
Tell it the way it really should be,<BR>
or let your days&#146; end begin.</P>
<P>Accept me, but as a fool is your reason<BR>
&#151;putting me down to your friends without thought.<BR>
When asked what you really think by me you fester<BR>
like the mold in your brain: one big clot of insane.</P>
<P>Magnitude rising; your palms start to sweat.<BR>
You&#146;re burning inside, and it&#146;s growing again.<BR>
Trying to be something truly you&#146;re not.<BR>
By tearing me down guess just where you will rot.</P>
<P>I can&#146;t help but feeling you wish to be different.<BR>
You are the one who is suffering inside.<BR>
Can&#146;t seem to let go; hold on to security.<BR>
Internal war&#151;it is yours. No, not mine.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
